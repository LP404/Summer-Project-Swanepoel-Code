#  Summer Project: 
Swanepoel Method Code that aims to interpret transmittance and reflectance data from a Spectrophotomer and apply the Swanepoel method to said data to obtain the refractive index and thickness of semiconductor samples.

## How to use:
- Put data (.txt) in the **Data** folder. *TransVSlowSam9.txt* is an example of how the txt should be formatted, if you are using a txt output from a Shimadzu UV-2700, you should be good to go.
- Run *code.py* **Note: Code.py is still unfinished, this message will be updated once I am happy with the code**
- Run *plotter.py* **Note: Also unfinished**
